This is code to implement the Desai Algorithm for classifying rEF and pEF based on administrative data. 

For background, it is best to go to the source paper. https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.118.004700?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub  0pubmed

The implementation details can be found in http://017c85b.netsolhost.com//wp-content/uploads/2018/12/EF-prediction-model-user-guide.pdf which include the definitions of the cofactors. 


Further implementation details can be found in the following two files which are written in SAS.
